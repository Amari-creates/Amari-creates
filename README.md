# ✈️ Hey there 👋

🌱 I’m new to tech and currently exploring the world of **Information Technology**
🔧 I love building things from scratch—whether it’s code, Lego sets, or DIY projects around the house. If I can create it, I’m all in!

👀 Outside of tech, I’m a huge aviation nerd. I used to work as a load planner at the airport, and my love for planes has only grown since. You’ll definitely catch me watching aviation documentaries or diving into anything plane-related in my free time.

🎯 Right now, I’m focused on:
- 🧠 Learning programming languages
- 🛡️ Building a strong IT and cybersecurity foundation
- 💻 Getting hands-on with CLI tools and networking protocols

📚 I’m passionate about learning, growing, and getting my hands dirty while I build!
